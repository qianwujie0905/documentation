Superun Cloud is a full-stack cloud platform that takes care of every part of your application — from the frontend your users see, to the backend that powers it behind the scenes. All you do is describe what you want directly in Superun, and Superun automatically generates both the frontend and backend, ready to run in the Cloud. Instead of managing hardware or complex infrastructure, you get on-demand access to hosting, compute, and storage that scale automatically as your app grows. Superun Cloud utilizes Supabase's open-source foundation, which means you get a production-ready environment from day one, without needing to set up Supabase separately. You have the power of a production-ready database, real-time updates, user auth, and storage — with none of the manual setup steps.

## Why choose Superun Cloud

* **Scales as you grow**: From your first prototype to millions of users, Superun scales seamlessly with your needs.
* **Secure by default**: Enterprise-grade authentication, fine-grained access controls, and compliance best practices protect your app and data.

## Enabling Superun Cloud

By default, Superun Cloud is enabled for your workspace. You can manage Superun Cloud behavior for your projects in your user preferences: **build → services → superun cloud.**

### User preferences

The default setting for Cloud integration is **Ask each time**, meaning you decide whether to enable or disable Cloud for each project. You can change your preference anytime from **build → services → superun cloud.** Superun prompts you when a feature requires backend functionality (for example, authentication or file storage). You have three options:
* **Allow**: enable the integration for the current project.
* **Deny**: decline the integration for this request (you may be asked again later).
* **Adjust preferences**: change the default behavior for future projects (does not affect the current project).

### Configuring Superun Cloud tools

Each Cloud tool in your user preferences has three options:
* **Always allow**: Superun automatically performs the action, without asking for review or approval.
* **Ask each time**: Superun asks for your approval whenever the action is needed.
* **Never allow**: Superun blocks the action, informs you that Cloud access is required, and instructs you to enable Cloud.

You can change your Cloud tools preferences anytime from **build → services → superun cloud.**

## Example flow - Prompting Superun to build a CRM tool

Here's a step-by-step example of how you might use Superun Cloud to build a CRM tool:

### Step 1: Organize the data (Database)

Start by describing the data you need:

```
I want to build a CRM tool. I need to store:
- Companies (name, industry, website, address)
- Contacts (name, email, phone, company they work for)
- Deals (title, value, stage, contact, company)
- Notes (content, related to deals or contacts)
```

Superun automatically creates the database schema and tables for you.

### Step 2: Make it secure (Users & Auth)

Ask Superun to add authentication:

```
Add user authentication. Only authenticated users should be able to access the CRM.
```

Superun configures authentication and generates signup/login pages for your app.

### Step 3: Handle files (Storage)

Request file upload functionality:

```
Add the ability to upload profile photos for contacts and company logos.
```

Superun sets up storage buckets and file upload components.

### Step 4: Automate workflows (Edge Functions)

Add custom backend logic:

```
Create an Edge Function that sends an email notification whenever a deal stage changes to "Won".
```

Superun creates the Edge Function and connects it to your database triggers.

### Step 5: Connect to other tools (Secrets)

Integrate external services:

```
Add Stripe integration for payment processing. Store the API key securely.
```

Superun prompts you to add your Stripe secret key, which is stored securely and made available to your Edge Functions.

### Step 6: Add AI superpowers (AI)

Enhance your app with AI:

```
Add AI-powered summaries for deal notes. When a user writes a note, automatically generate a summary.
```

Superun integrates AI functionality to automatically generate summaries using the built-in AI.
