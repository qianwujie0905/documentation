Superun bakes thoughtful SEO defaults into every page and component. This guide explains those automatic optimizations and how to further tune your Superun‑generated pages for search engines.

## Automatic SEO Features

Superun ships the following SEO helpers by default on new pages:

* Keep title tags to ~60 characters and include primary keywords
* Write meta descriptions (~160 characters max) with natural keyword usage
* Use exactly one H1 per page that reflects the page intent and key terms
* Structure content with semantic HTML elements
* Optimize images and add descriptive, keyword‑relevant alt text
* Add JSON‑LD structured data for products, articles, and FAQs when appropriate
* Boost performance with image lazy‑loading and deferring non‑critical scripts
* Use canonical URLs to consolidate duplicate content
* Apply a mobile‑first responsive layout with a correct viewport
* Prefer clean, human‑readable, descriptive URLs

## Generating SEO Files

Superun makes it easy to generate essential SEO files (`robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`) directly from the interface:

1. Click "Launch" in the top navigation bar.
2. In the left sidebar, select "SEO".
3. In the SEO File section, click "Generate" to automatically create both `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`.
4. Click "Check" to verify the files are properly generated.
5. Click "Publish" to deploy your changes with the new SEO files.

These files are essential for search engine indexing and help crawlers discover and index your pages efficiently.

## Built‑in Page Speed Optimization

Superun includes a speed audit powered by Google Lighthouse—an open‑source analyzer for performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices. To run an audit in Superun:

1. Click "Launch" in the top navigation bar.
2. In the left sidebar, select "Performance".
3. Review the SEO scorecard and category‑specific recommendations. Use "Try to fix" to follow the actions that improve load time, rankings, and user experience.

Quick wins include removing unused scripts, compressing and lazy‑loading images, applying code‑splitting for on‑demand loading, using a CDN, and cutting render‑blocking resources on first paint.


## Tips and Tricks
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Sitemap for Search Engine Indexing">
        A sitemap helps search engines crawl and index your website efficiently. You can generate it automatically using the interface method described in the "Generating SEO Files" section above, or manually:
        
        1. Go to **Launch → SEO** and click "Generate" to create `sitemap.xml` automatically.
        2. After publishing, in Google Search Console → Sitemaps, submit `https://yourdomain/sitemap.xml` (replace `yourdomain` with your custom domain).
        3. The `sitemap.xml` reference is automatically added to your `robots.txt` when generated via the interface.

        Keep the sitemap fresh (update periodically or automate during builds). To verify quickly: `curl https://yourdomain/sitemap.xml`.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Robots.txt Configuration for Search Control">
        The `robots.txt` file instructs search engines which paths to crawl or ignore. You can generate it automatically using the interface method described in the "Generating SEO Files" section above, or manually:
        
        1. Go to **Launch → SEO** and click "Generate" to create `robots.txt` automatically.
        2. The generated file will be placed at your site's root with default settings. For example:
        
        ```txt
        User-agent: *
        Allow: /
        Sitemap: https://yourdomain/sitemap.xml
        ```
        
        3. If you need to customize rules, you can edit the file directly in your repository to allow or block specific paths as needed.
        
        Use `Disallow` sparingly to avoid accidentally hiding important content.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Internal Linking for Better SEO">
        Internal links help both users and crawlers navigate your site. Superun can help:
        
        * Suggest relevant internal links between pages.
        * Ensure logical site architecture for easy indexing.
        * Improve page authority with proper linking strategies.
        
        How to add internal links in Superun:
        1. Use prompts like “Suggest internal links for this page.”
        2. Add links to related content in your project.
        3. Keep anchor text descriptive and relevant.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Customize Your Shared Image (OG)">
        When your project is shared on social platforms, customize the preview image in two ways:
        
        <b>Let AI handle it</b>
        
        Upload an image and use a simple prompt like:
        
        ```
        Can you change the OG image that appears when the site is shared on social media platforms to the one above?
        ```
        
        <b>Manual via repository</b>
        
        1. Open your project repository and navigate to the `public` folder.
        2. Replace the existing `og-image.png` with your new image.
        3. Rename your new image to `og-image.png` (recommended 1200×630).
