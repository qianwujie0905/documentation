# Dashboard (Use Case)

Building a dashboard with Prompt-to-Design is fast and beginner-friendly.  
Here is the **final result** you can create with just a few prompts and quick refinements:

  alt="Final dashboard result"
  width="620"
/>

You only need a clear prompt describing **structure + content + style**, and AI generates a complete SaaS-style dashboard layout for you.

---

## 1. Write Your First Prompt

Start by describing the layout, components, and design style you want.

For this example, we use:

> **"Create a clean product analytics dashboard for a SaaS web app."**

Include key sections (sidebar, KPI cards, charts, table) to give AI enough context.

## 2. AI Generates the First Dashboard Layout

Prompt-to-Design instantly creates the first version of your dashboard - complete with sidebar navigation, top bar, KPI stats, chart placeholders, and a data table.

<img
  src="/images/dashboard/startboard.png"
  alt="First dashboard draft"
  width="620"
/>

This serves as your **initial base layout**, ready for enhancements.

## 3. Improve the "Analytics" Chart (Region Redesign)

The Analytics bar is simple.  
Use **Region Redesign** to turn it into a fully designed area chart with labels and improved visual clarity.

Prompt:

> **"Replace this image with a real area chart showing daily active users, using a clean SaaS visual style."**

<img
  src="/images/dashboard/analytics.png"
  alt="Analytics chart redesign"
  width="620"
/>

The chart now matches the dashboard's professional look.

## 4. Enhance the "Top Channels" Card (Smart Fill)

The original card is minimal.  
Use **Smart Fill** to make it richer and more informative.

Prompt:

> **"Improve this Top Channels card with icons, horizontal bars, and percentages in a compact layout."**

<img
  src="/images/dashboard/channel.png"
  alt="Channel card improved"
  width="620"
/>

AI automatically adds meaningful structure and balanced visual hierarchy.

---

## 5. Improve the "Recent Activities" Table

Use Region Redesign or Smart Fill to enrich the table with icons, filters, and pagination.

Prompt:

> **"Add icons, pagination controls, and status tags to make the Recent Activities table feel complete."**

<img
  src="/images/dashboard/activities.png"
  alt="Activities table improved"
  width="620"
/>

The section becomes more scannable and visually organized.
