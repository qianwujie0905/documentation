# Landing Page (Use Case)

Creating a landing page with Prompt-to-Design is simple and beginner-friendly.  
Here is the **final result** you can achieve using Kickstart + Region Redesign:

<img
  src="/images/landing-page/landing.png"
  alt="Final landing page result"
  width="620"
/>

Prompt-to-Design generates the entire structure for you - you only need clear prompts describing  
**structure + content + style**, and the AI will create a complete, editable landing page.

## 1. Generate the First Version with Kickstart

Open the plugin - select **Kick Start**.  
Enter a simple prompt describing the landing page layout you want.

For this example, we use:

> Create a modern SaaS landing page.
>
> Sections:
> - Hero with headline, subtext, and a main illustration  
> - Three feature blocks in a grid  
> - A simple testimonial section  
> - A call-to-action area at the bottom  
>
> Style: clean, minimal, soft colors.

Click **Generate**, and Prompt-to-Design creates the first full layout:

<img
  src="/images/landing-page/start.png"
  alt="Kickstart landing page"
  width="620"
/>

This layout serves as your **initial base structure**, ready for refinement.

## 2. Improve All Content Sections (Feature + Layout Cleanup)

The Kickstart result includes simple three-card feature blocks and basic content structure.  
To make the entire landing page cleaner, more consistent, and more professional,  
we refine **all content sections**, not just the feature block.

Use **Region Redesign** with a prompt such as:

> Improve this section with better spacing, stronger icons,  
> clearer hierarchy, and more visual balance.  
> Make it look like a professional SaaS landing page.

The updated section now looks cleaner and more polished:

<img
  src="/images/landing-page/section.png"
  alt="Improved feature section"
  width="620"
/>

## 3. Enhance the Testimonial Section (More Credibility)

The autogenerated testimonial section tends to look simple and lightweight.  
We can use Region Redesign to improve professionalism and trust.

**Prompt:**

> Make this testimonial section more credible and polished.  
> Add a customer avatar, improve typography,  
> and add a soft background card.

**Result:**

<img
  src="/images/landing-page/Testimonial.png"
  alt="Improved testimonial section"
  width="620"
/>

The layout becomes more trustworthy and visually balanced ¡ª  
perfect for SaaS landing pages.

## 4. Strengthen the Bottom CTA (Optional Enhancement)

Your CTA already works, but you can increase the visual emphasis for a stronger ending.

**Prompt:**

> Strengthen this CTA section with bolder typography,  
> a clearer headline, and a more visually appealing background gradient.

**Updated CTA:**

<img
  src="/images/landing-page/ctd.png"
  alt="CTA redesign result"
  width="620"
/>

This creates a clean and visually satisfying final call-to-action.

---

## Final Result

After Kickstart + multiple Region Redesign improvements,  
you get a fully polished landing page ready for use in Figma:

<img
  src="/images/landing-page/landing.png"
  alt="Final landing page"
  width="620"
/>

Clean, modern, and fully editable - created in minutes using Prompt-to-Design.
