# Region Design

Region Design lets you modify a specific area of a Figma frame without disrupting the rest of your design.  
You can select any region, describe your intended change, and Prompt.to.design regenerates that section while maintaining alignment, proportions, and hierarchy.

## Overview

This feature is designed for iterative workflows where designers only need to adjust certain sections.  
The model understands spatial relationships and preserves harmony between the updated region and the surrounding layout.

## Key Capabilities

- Localized redesign for selected areas  
- Maintains style coherence with the original layout  
- Supports both web and mobile frames  
- Allows controlled iteration without full regeneration  

## When to Use Region Design

Use Region Design when improving or experimenting with specific areas of your design, such as headers, hero sections, or call-to-action blocks.
