title: Region Design
description: Update specific sections of your Figma design while keeping the rest unchanged using Region Design feature in Prompt.to.design.
---

Region Design lets you **change only one part of the page**, while keeping the rest of the layout and style the same.

It is perfect for updating the **hero section**, a card, or any content block without rebuilding the whole page.

---

## 1. Select the Region

In Figma, select the frame or section you want to improve.  
In this example, we select the **hero section** of a resume page.

---

## 2. Open "Region Design"

In the plugin, click the **Region Design** tab.

<img
  src="/images/region-redesign/button.png"
  alt="Region Design button and prompt input"
/>

Write a short prompt describing how you want to change this area, for example:

> "Redesign this hero section to be more visual and modern, but keep the page's overall style."

Then click **Generate**.

---

## 3. Result: Updated Hero, Same Page Style

The plugin keeps:

- The page layout
- The global style (colors, spacing, typography)
- Your existing content outside the selected region

It only redesigns the selected section based on your prompt.

<img
  src="/images/region-redesign/compare.png"
  alt="Region Design before and after comparison"
/>

On the left is the **original hero**. On the right is the **new hero**: more visual and modern,  
but still matching the rest of the page.

---

Region Design helps you quickly try new ideas for one area of the page  
without breaking the overall design.
