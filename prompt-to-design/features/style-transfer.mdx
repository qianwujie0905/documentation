title: Style Transfer
---

Style Transfer lets you **pick any existing Figma frame as a style reference**, and apply its color, typography, and spacing style to a new design instantly.

It keeps your **content**, while updating the **visual style** to match the selected reference.

---

## 1. Choose "Style Transfer"

Click the **Style Transfer** button in the plugin.

<img src="/images/style-transfer/button.png" alt="Generated sample" width="520" />

Select the frame you want to use as your **style reference**, then enter a short description of the new page you want to generate.

---

## 2. Before - Original Design (Content Source)

This is the original design:  
a clean, simple resume layout with blue and white tones.

<img src="/images/style-transfer/before.png" alt="Generated sample" width="520" />

This layout will be used as the **content source**.

---

## 3. After - New Layout in the Selected Style

Here is the generated result:  
the **same resume content**, but redesigned using the strong visual style of the reference frame (red + yellow school theme).

<img src="/images/style-transfer/after.png" alt="Generated sample" width="520" />

The colors, typography, spacing, and overall feel now match the selected reference style - while keeping your original content and layout structure.
